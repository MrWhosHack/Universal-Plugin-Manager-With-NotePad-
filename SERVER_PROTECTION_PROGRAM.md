# Server Protection Program

Server owners/operators who believe their platforms are being abused by unapproved plugins may request protections.

## How It Works
- Submit a request via the official GitHub repository including: server name, domain/IP, nature of abuse, and desired protections.
- Licensor may issue a blocklist update or policy restrictions to reduce abuse.

## Possible Measures
- Blocklist of known abusive plugin hashes.
- Hard-disable of certain plugin categories in protected mode.
- Notices and in-app warnings to users connecting to protected servers.

## Process & Timelines
- Initial response target: 5–10 business days.
- Emergency disclosures for imminent harm prioritized.

## Data & Privacy
- Only minimal technical data required to enforce protections.

## Contact
Open an issue on the official GitHub repository to apply.
